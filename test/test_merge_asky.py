Bring the best in you
Work for Krishna inside you, instead of indulging the demands of your body, or the constraints of your environment. That’s what we explore in these three shlokas.
How do we get to know Krishna?
Chapter 8, Shloka 25
In Chapter 8, Krishna explains why people worship. It's to go beyond the cycles of the universe.
This shloka mentions the moon, the seasons, and smoke. Everyone is in this cycle.
Your body is borrowed from things in the universe. It eventually returns.

But what about you? What do you live for? Do you have a purpose beyond these cycles? Perhaps something holds you from achieving your best.
What obstacles come in the way of our lives?
Chapter 14, Shloka 1
This shloka is at the start of Chapter 14, in which Krishna talks about obstacles. These obstacles keep you from looking beyond your cycles. How can you overcome them, to achieve your goals?
In life, you do more than just exist. You love, learn, and discover. Discovering liberates. For example, discovering a valuable skill can liberate you from financial constraints. Discovering discipline can help you stay healthy.
Is there a path of discovery that liberates you, to be your best? What stops you from that path?
Within your body, three qualities pull you back: contentment, restlessness, and laziness. They bring experiences like complacency, excitement, boredom, greed, attachment, and disinterest. If you don't control them, they will divert and distract you.
You drift away.
Is your purpose just to satisfy your body's needs, as per your contentment, restlessness, and laziness? If not, what is your purpose? Is it liberation from your limits?
Krishna says that devotion liberates. You will discover infinity within yourself.
What is devotion in practice?
Devotion is a relation of friendship, regard, and dedication. Think of something you like doing; something important. You commit and do it as well. Such a relationship is devotion.
It brings out the best in you. 
But can anything be like that? What’s Important today, may not seem that important in the future. You liked something before, but you don't like it anymore. Is there anything that's permanently important, friendly, and available? Is it Krishna?
Can you make a relationship of devotion with Krishna, the origin of the universe? He's always friendly, always present inside you.
But hey, what about your daily life? You are in this body. You need to eat when you're hungry, earn a living and make friends. You cannot stop all that. Is there a way to be in the cycle and be devoted, at the same time? Krishna tells us how.
What are Krishna's instructions?
Chapter 18, Shloka 1
In Chapter 18, Krishna instructs you to surrender.
It starts with this shloka, in which Arjuna asks about giving up and letting go. If you don't work for your body's needs, does it mean you stop working completely? Do you then give up all activities?
Is it possible to live without doing anything? No.
So, how can you go beyond the cycle of activity?
Step up, and recognize that you aren't the only cause of your actions.
You aren't entitled to your expectations either. This is called letting go.
By letting go, you give your best at present, without the limitation of the past.
The body's desires and surroundings will influence you, but that's your nature.
Even then, your intentions are independent of the environment. For example, a mother intends to provide good nutrition. Her environment can be one of shortage or plenty, even when everyone is confused about what nutrition is good.
Whatever be your environment, intend to work for Krishna.
Sometimes, your work may not sound significant. Does Krishna accept simple work? Of course, Krishna treasures anything offered with devotion. By the way, all your work is simple, when compared to Krishna’s creations. Engage in your work, complete with the conviction that Krishna enjoys inside you.
Anxiety and regret come from believing that outcomes belong to you. You might do things for friends, family, or even for fun. You may even have expectations in return. Let that go as well. Do the same for Krishna instead.
Devotion to your work is devotion to Krishna, because Krishna is in everything. So why hold back? Devote and dedicate to everything you do.
Try it out now. Does it bring out the best in you?
